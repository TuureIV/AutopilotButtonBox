# AutopilotBox
This projecti is made for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and is made to control basic autopilot functions and elevator trim.
Code base is from Ari Oinas https://github.com/aoinas/smart-rotary-button-box but I made some big changes and added self-made library Buttons.h it uses also Joystick.h (Matthew Heironimus, ttps://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary) library and Encoders.h (Matthias Hertel, http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/RotaryEncoderLibrary.aspx) libraries
Code uses these hardware: 3x rotary encoder switch, 4x push buttons, Arduino pro micro (Atmel32u4) and a potentiometer.
